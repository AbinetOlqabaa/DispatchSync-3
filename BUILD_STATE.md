# Build State — Business Dispatch & Delivery Reconciliation (DispatchBridge)

- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-22T20:05:00-07:00
- **Runtime / Platform:** Node.js v22.14.0 on Linux container with Express 4 backend & Vite 8 React 19 Frontend. Configured as an installable mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA). *Note: Native Android build tooling (Gradle / Android SDK) is not supported in this runtime environment.*
- **Stack:**
  - Backend: Node.js, Express 4, TypeScript, HMAC SHA-256 session tokens, timing-safe one-time bootstrap tokens, in-memory domain adapter (`sandboxStore`) with full multi-tenant isolation.
  - Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React, Context API (`AuthContext`, `LanguageContext`, `ThemeContext`), clean component and page architecture.
  - Test Suite: Node.js TypeScript test runner (`npm test` -> `tsx test/runTests.ts`).

## 2. Verified Working Features vs. Sandbox-Only Features

### Fully Working & Verified in Runtime:
1. **Live Geo-Coordinates Delivery Tracking Map (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - High-contrast interactive SVG map component displaying active origin dock, destination partner dock, and current vehicle coordinates.
   - Coordinates HUD displaying formatted degrees (e.g. `44.09770° N, 91.74423° W`), speed (`80 km/h`), heading (`310° NW`), and checkpoint waypoint.
   - Live telemetry status badge, percentage completion tracker (73% completed), distance covered (416 km), and remaining corridor distance (155 km).
   - Dynamic vector route lines (covered neon sky glow route + anticipated amber dashed route).
   - Vehicle pin with pulsing radar beacon rings and truck insignia.
   - Map controls: Zoom in, Zoom out, Reset / Fit Route Bounds, 1-click "Copy Lat/Lng" button, and direct external Google Maps link (`https://www.google.com/maps?q=lat,lng`).
   - "Simulate GPS Ping" action to record live telemetry updates via `POST /api/dispatches/:id/telemetry`, updating coordinates dynamically in runtime.
2. **Planned vs. Actual Route Polylines (`mapCache.ts` & `DispatchTrackingMap`):**
   - 9 planned waypoint corridor overlay (`wp_p0` to `wp_p8`) connecting Chicago loading dock to Minneapolis destination.
   - 5 actual historical breadcrumb coordinates (`wp_a0` to `wp_a4`) with speed and timestamps.
   - Interactive popover inspection on breadcrumb pins and corridor variance tracker (`Corridor Variance: 0.0 km • 98.4% Adherence`).
   - Dynamic waypoint appending on incoming live telemetry pings.
3. **Offline Map Caching Strategy (`mapCache.ts`):**
   - Universal storage (browser `localStorage` + fallback memory store) caching tile bounds, waypoints, and coordinates.
   - Offline detection banner and queueing system for telemetry pings recorded while offline.
4. **Driver QR Barcode Scanner & Transit Checkpoints (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - Live camera viewfinder emulator + manual barcode input.
   - Quick package presets for manifest waybill and individual cargo lines.
   - Updates transit milestone status (`IN_TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `ARRIVED_AT_DOCK`), waypoint checkpoint, and driver notes.
5. **PDF Manifest Waybill Export (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - High-fidelity PDF document generation via `jspdf` for offline dock records.
   - Includes origin, destination, carrier license plate, tracking link, and full itemized cargo table.
6. **Bulk CSV Dispatch Upload (`DispatchListPage`):**
   - Downloadable standard CSV template (`dispatch_reference`, `partner_name`, `destination_address`, `driver_name`, `sku`, `item_name`, `unit`, `quantity`).
   - Line-by-line validation, grouping by dispatch reference, and automatic partner registration.
7. **Executive Analytics Dashboard (`BusinessOwnerDashboard`):**
   - SVG Donut Chart showing fulfillment success rate (66.6% delivered intact).
   - Milestone lead times (dispatch → view → dock receipt → discrepancy resolution).
   - Loss Root Cause breakdown (Damaged vs Shortage).
8. **Multi-Language Selector (5 Languages):**
   - English (`en`), Amharic (`am` / `አማርኛ`), Afan Oromo (`om` / `Afaan Oromoo`), Tigrigna (`ti` / `ትግርኛ`), and Somali (`so` / `Soomaali`).
   - Dynamic locale switching and translation across navbar, tables, statuses, and buttons.
9. **Dark / Light / System Theme Mode:**
   - Persisted in `localStorage` under `dispatchbridge_theme` and synchronized to `document.documentElement.className`.
10. **Summary Metric Cards with Recharts Trends:**
    - Pending Deliveries, Total Value in Transit ($4,625.00), and Completed Today with responsive Sparkline/Area/Bar chart projections.
11. **Export Dispatches List to CSV / PDF Report:**
    - Multi-format filtered dispatch records export.
12. **Tablet First-Class Navigation & Layout (Portrait & Landscape):**
    - Dedicated tablet navigation strip spanning full viewport width for 768px-1279px viewports, eliminating center header navigation squishing.
    - Balanced 2x2 metric card grids on tablet portrait; 4 columns on landscape and desktop.
    - Zero page-level horizontal overflow; cleanly bounded table scroll areas with `.scrollbar-thin` styling.

### Sandbox Mode Notice:
- Persistent storage currently uses the in-memory `sandboxStore` adapter with pre-seeded demonstration data. Cloud database (e.g., Cloud SQL / Firestore) and external SMS/WhatsApp gateway credentials remain unconfigured until staging deployment. Transparent sandbox banners are displayed in the UI.

### Release Verdict:
**READY FOR STAGING**

---

## 5. Changes Made in This Session
- **Resolution of Tablet Landscape Truncation Bug (`Navbar.tsx`)**:
  - Root Cause: In tablet landscape (1024x768 and 1180x820), the top navbar was crammed with logo on left, 7 center items in a constrained container, and user profile on right, causing "Audit Trail" to truncate to `Au...` and hiding "System Status".
  - Fix: Changed center desktop nav items to `hidden xl:flex` (starting at 1280px desktop). Expanded dedicated tablet navigation bar from `hidden md:flex lg:hidden` to `hidden md:flex xl:hidden`, providing full-width span across all 7 items with complete labels, clear icons, and >=44px touch targets on all tablet viewports (768px - 1279px).
- **Public Sandbox Exploration for Unauthenticated Visitors (`DispatchListPage.tsx`)**:
  - Root Cause: Guest users without a logged-in session were shown "No dispatches match this filter" because `useEffect` set dispatches to `[]` when `user` was null, despite the server providing public demo dispatches.
  - Fix: Allowed `loadDispatches()` to execute for both guest and authenticated users. Guest users now immediately view active sandbox shipments (`DSP-2026-0081`, etc.) and populated metric cards ($4,625.00 in transit).
- **Dashboard Outbound Dispatches Table Optimization (`BusinessOwnerDashboard.tsx`)**:
  - Replaced fixed column clipping with responsive `w-full min-w-[640px] md:min-w-full` and tighter `px-3 py-3` padding.
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` to table header `<th>` cells to prevent awkward word breaks (`RECO\nOUT`).
- **Metric Grid Balance on Tablet Portrait (`SenderDashboard.tsx`, `SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`)**:
  - Updated card grids from `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` to `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`, achieving a balanced 2x2 grid on tablet portrait (768x1024 and 820x1180) and 4 columns on landscape/desktop.
- **Custom Thin Scrollbar Utilities (`src/index.css`)**:
  - Added `.scrollbar-thin` utility for table containers to provide unobtrusive, styled scrollbars on tablet and desktop browsers.
- **Automated Test Suite Expansion (`test/runTests.ts`)**:
  - Added Test #24: `Guest Exploration & Tablet Responsive Data: Public sandbox dispatches accessible without auth token`.
  - All 24 tests pass with 0 failures (`npm test`).
- **Visual Browser Verification Across Matrix (`playwright-cli`)**:
  - Captured and inspected screenshots:
    - Tablet Portrait: 768x1024 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-portrait-768.png`) & 820x1180 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-portrait-820.png`).
    - Tablet Landscape: 1024x768 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-landscape-1024.png`) & 1180x820 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-landscape-1180.png`).
    - Mobile Portrait: 390x844 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-mobile-390.png`).
    - Desktop: 1440x900 (`.playwright-cli/matrix-desktop-1440.png`).

## 7. Next Recommended Actions
1. **Production Infrastructure Transition**: When deploying to production environments, configure persistent PostgreSQL / Cloud SQL via Drizzle ORM or Firestore using the platform's provisioning skills.
2. **External Gateway Credentials**: Configure SMS / WhatsApp webhook credentials in the platform's secure secrets store for live external carrier notifications.
